# Logging_Redaction_Utility  
A set of subclasses that override `logging.Formatter` and `logging.Filter`, combined with a decorator factory for easy integration with named loggers.  

In this example, the wrapped function makes a simple request to retrieve and update a list of known malicious IPs from an OSINT source.  

The logger decorator factory wraps the function, produces a named logger with its own filter, and redacts any sensitive data emitted during the function call.  

----------

## Nitty-Gritty  

- **Redaction Formatter Class** -> recursively removes sensitive keys (`user_id`, `token`, `password`, `ip`) from structured logs using DFS.  
- **String Redaction Filter** -> uses regex-based redaction for unstructured log strings, so nothing slips through the cracks.  
- **Logger Decorator Factory** -> enables modular integration of logging, named loggers, and per-function log levels for any Python function you choose to wrap.  

----------

### Additional Jazzy Functionality  

- Per-function log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, etc.)  
- A toggleable debug trace flag to inspect pre-redacted logs  
- Optional JSON output for structured logging pipelines  

----------

## My Inspiration for this Project
Security and observability, or rather security and engineering in general sometimes clash. Sometimes you need detailed logs, but you canâ€™t risk leaking any secrets.  

This utility allows for safe logging by default while staying flexible enough for debugging and pipeline integration.
